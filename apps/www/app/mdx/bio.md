Hi there 👋🏼! I'm **Willy Ovalle**, a software developer based in Berlin, Germany 🇩🇪. I grew up in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic 🇩🇴, graduated in [Telecommunications Engineering](https://www.pucmm.edu.do/ingenierias/telematica) and have a Master's in [Science of Networking and Systems Administration](https://www.rit.edu/study/networking-and-systems-administration-ms). I currently work with social advertising automation at [smartly.io](https://smartly.io) (prev [klarna](https://klarna.com), [instacarro](https://instacarro.com)).

I have been working professionally [since 2012](${linkedin}) (_damn has it been that long?_ 😥), working in small and big companies in Santo Domingo, Austin, Stockholm and now Berlin. I started my career working with .NET (along many other Microsoft technologies), these days I do most of my work in [typescript](https://typescriptlang.org) (and js in general). Some tools/technologies I'm interested in: typescript, node, docker, k8s, jamstack, serverless.

I spend my free time [playing music](#top-tracks), [reading](#books) (_mostly listening tbh_) books, doing [open source work](https://github.com/wovalle), enjoying time with friends and family and watching _way too much_ youtube. Catch me up on **[twitter](${twitter})**… or don’t, it's your call; I’m only a biography after all.
